Welcome to AMLOV-FinTech's GitHub Organization.
We are building trusted infrastructure, compliance systems, and future-proof fintech solutions for institutions, enterprises, and the public sector.
A few important guidelines as you begin collaborating with us:
Security first: Please use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your GitHub account.
Commit clarity: Clear commit messages help us stay auditable and efficient.
Branch discipline: Feature branches should be used for all new work; master/main remains protected.
Respect compliance: Our systems and code may interface with regulated environments. Handle data responsibly at all times.
If you have any questions about workflows, policies, or the mission we're building toward, feel free to reach out directly.
Thank you for being part of AMLOV’s journey. Let’s build something secure, resilient, and transformative.
